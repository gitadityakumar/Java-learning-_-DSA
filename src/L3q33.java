        Where:

A is the future value of the investment or loan, including both the principal and compound interest.
P is the initial principal (the initial amount of money).
R is the annual interest rate (as a decimal).
n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
t is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.
The key takeaway is that compound interest allows your money to grow or debts to increase at an accelerating rate over time, as each compounding period incorporates the previous interest. This concept is often used in savings accounts, investments, loans, mortgages, and other financial products. Compound interest can lead to significant differences in the final amount compared to simple interest,
 especially over long periods or with high compounding frequencies.
